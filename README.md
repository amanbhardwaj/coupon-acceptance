# coupon-acceptance
Exploratory data analysis of user and contextual attributes that impact acceptance of coupons that people receive while driving.

Coupon Groups: Restaurant(<20), Coffee House, Carry out & Take away, Bar, Restaurant(20-50)
Groups analysed: Bar and Restaurant(20-50)

A - Bar Coupons

Based on the observations, drivers with high acceptance rate of the bar coupons are the onces:
- who go to a bar more than 3 times a month (0.769)
- who go to a bar more than once a month (0.688)
- who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 (0.695)
- who go to a bar more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid (0.713)
- who go to a bar more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry (0.713)
- who go to a bar more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed (0.713)
- who go to a bar more than once a month and are under the age of 30 (0.722)

NOTE: Upon closer look, all the drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid, they all have occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry and are not widowed.

Therefore based on my hypothesis the folloing drivers are more likely to accept Bar coupons:
- who go to a bar more than 3 times a month.
- who go to a bar more than once a month.
- who go to a bar more than once a month and are between the age of 25 and 30.
- who go to a bar more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid.

B - Restaurant(20-50) Coupons

Hypothesis based on observations

Characteristics and contextual attributes of people who are twice as likely to accept a coupon from more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50) are:
People who go to a expensive restaurant 1-3 times a month, are unmarried partners, while driving with a partner in a sunny weather around 10 AM
